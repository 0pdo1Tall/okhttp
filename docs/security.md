## Securing Older Android Clients

Applications expected to be installed on older Android devices should consider adopting the Google Play 
Services Provider. This will increase security for users and reduce frequent issues with incompatiblities 
with modern webservers that assume a secure set of cipher suites and TLS version.

The handshake result is generally an intersection of the Device, Android Version, OkHttp version and WebServer.
If you get handshake failures on older devices, start by looking at whether adopting the GMS Provider will help.
Conversely look at whether the server you are connecting to is secure.

OkHttp follows security best practices and will fail requests rather than make insecure connections.
